# Task 3 – Data Visualization using Python 📊

This is *Task 3* of the *CodeAlpha Data Science Internship, which focuses on **Data Visualization using Python*. The goal is to extract insights from an Electric Vehicle dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves:
- Loading and cleaning EV specification data
- Creating visual insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Understanding brand performance, efficiency, and vehicle capabilities

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a CSV file:  
electric_vehicles_spec_2025.csv

It includes columns such as:
- brand
- battery_capacity_kWh
- range_km
- efficiency_wh_per_km
- acceleration_0_to_100_km_h

---

## 📊 Visualizations Created

1. *Top 10 EV Brands by Number of Models*  
2. *Battery Capacity vs. Range (km)*  
3. *Efficiency Distribution (Wh/km)*  
4. *Acceleration (0–100 km/h) Comparison (Top 5 Brands)*

All plots are generated using matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn.
